Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Life Expectancy:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Life expectancy is the average number of additional years a person at a specific age (such as at birth or age 65 years) could expect to live, if he or she were to experience the age-specific mortality rates of the reference period throughout his/her life. For example, a new-born with a life expectancy at birth of 80 years could expect to live to the age of 80 years. A 65-year-old with a life expectancy at age 65 years of 12 years could expect to live an additional 12 years. Life expectancy does not account for future changes in mortality. It provides an indication of the average longevity of the population; but, it is not necessarily a reflection of the longevity of an individual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Resident Households:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refer to households where the household reference person is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident.
A household refers to (i) a group of two or more persons living together in the same house and sharing common food or other essential arrangements for living; or (ii) a person living alone or a person living with others but having his own food or other essential arrangements for living. Although persons may be living in the same house, they may not be members of the same household.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
